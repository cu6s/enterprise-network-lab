Cisco Packet Tracer enterprise network lab featuring VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, DHCP, NAT, and ACLs
# Enterprise Network Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
The lab simulates a real-world office environment with proper network segmentation, routing, and security controls.

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS
- IPv4 Subnetting

## Network Design
- VLAN-based network segmentation
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Centralised DHCP services
- NAT for internet connectivity
- OSPF dynamic routing
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic control

## Objectives
- Design a structured and scalable network
- Implement routing and segmentation
- Apply basic security controls
- Troubleshoot network connectivity issues

## What I Learned
- Enterprise-style IP addressing and subnetting
- Routing between multiple VLANs
- Applying ACLs to control network access
- Identifying and fixing misconfigurations

## Files Included
- Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) file
- Network topology diagram
- Configuration notes
